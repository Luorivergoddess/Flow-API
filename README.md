## üëã Welcome to Flow-API!

Tired of juggling multiple API keys and navigating complex documentation for different services? Flow-API is here to streamline your workflow! We provide a powerful **API aggregation platform** that acts as a central hub for all your third-party API needs.

Imagine managing APIs for cloud storage, payment processing, AI models, and communication services ‚Äì all through **one consistent interface** and **one set of credentials**. Flow-API makes this a reality, simplifying integration, reducing complexity, and saving you valuable development time.

Whether you're a solo developer, a startup, or a large enterprise, Flow-API empowers you to connect, manage, and monitor your essential services effortlessly.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üîë **Unified API Access:** Say goodbye to provider-specific SDKs and authentication methods. Interact with diverse services (like OpenAI, Stripe, AWS S3, Twilio, etc. - *examples*) using a single, standardized Flow-API endpoint.
*   üîê **Centralized Key Management:** Securely store and manage your API keys from various providers within your Flow-API account. No more scattering sensitive credentials across different projects or environments.
*   üìä **Intuitive Dashboard:** Get a clear overview of your connected services, monitor API call usage, track spending, and manage your account settings through a clean and modern web interface.
*   üí∞ **Wallet & Token System:** Manage your Flow-API balance, purchase credits (tokens), and monitor costs associated with your API usage across all connected services.
*   üìö **Integrated Documentation:** Access clear, concise documentation not only for the Flow-API platform itself but also for the specific endpoints of the integrated third-party services, all in one place.
*   üë§ **Secure User Authentication:** Robust login and registration system to protect your account and API keys.
*   üîå **Extensible Architecture:** Designed with future growth in mind, allowing for easy integration of new API providers.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The Flow-API project is organized into two main components:

*   `./frontend`: The sleek and responsive user interface built with Next.js, allowing users to manage their accounts, keys, and services.
*   `./backend`: (Coming Soon!) The core engine built with Go. This service will handle the actual API request routing, authentication with third-party providers, data persistence, and the main business logic.
